# 🤝 FriendApp

**FriendApp** is a lightweight and fun web app where you can manage your friends list with style, a touch of humor, and even a doodle or two.

Built using **Flask** and a **pre-compiled React frontend (served via Flask)**, this app lets you:

- 👤 Add a new friend to your list
- ❌ Remove old friends
- 🎨 Display a doodle fetched from an external API
- 🌗 Toggle between light and dark mode

> FriendApp isn’t just another CRUD app — it's a visual and interactive way to rethink what a friend list could feel like.
